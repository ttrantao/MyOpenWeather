# MyVestiaireWeather

This is a native iOS weather application using Open Weather API. Just self-learning Swift at home. 
I am using only one 3rd party library : Kingfisher which is a very powerful library used for asynchronous image downloading and caching.

I'm using the **One call API** only for now. Currently, the app is similar to Weather app from Apple, it displays :
* Current weather
* Hourly forecast for 48 hours
* Daily forecast for 7 days
in Paris.

Things that will be improved/done in the future :
* Cache all data
* Use CoreData
* Add localization (application is implemented in English currently)
* Add Geolocalization to display different forecast in other cities than Paris
* Add a settings view to allow user to choose the metric unit displayed (show in Farenheit/Celcius)
* Add Unit tests 
* Add an minute forecast
* Add historical data for previous days
* Add a day detail view
* Possibility of displaying multiple cities
